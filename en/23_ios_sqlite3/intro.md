SQLite databases are often used by the applications to store persistent
or temporary data which can be further used by the application at later
stages. For example, in order to provide seamless experience to the
user, an application may store user credentials in SQLite database so
that the user doesn't need to enter them again later on. However, these
databases don't have any built-in support for encryption and hence, all
the information is stored in plain-text format in these files.
