Android API offers WebView to deliver a web application (or just a web
page) as a part of a client app. A common scenario in which using
WebView is helpful is when you want to provide information in your
application that you might need to update, such as an end-user agreement
or a user guide. Another scenario is if your application provides data
to the user that always requires an Internet connection to retrieve
data, such as email. In this case, you might find that it's easier to
build a WebView in your Android application that shows a web page with
all the user data, rather than performing a network request, then
parsing the data and rendering it in an Android layout.
