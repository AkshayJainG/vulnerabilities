Couch databases are used by the applications to store data which can be
further used by the application at later stages. However, these
databases don't have any built-in support for encryption and hence, all
the information is stored in plain-text format in these files. If an
application stores user credentials or some sensitive user specific data
in this database then it can be accessed by any third party.
