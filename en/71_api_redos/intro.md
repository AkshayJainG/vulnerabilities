The Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack,
that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach
extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related
to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a regular expression
to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.
