An HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) is a type of message authentication
code used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authentication of a message.
Any cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC;
the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA-1 accordingly.
The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying
hash function, the size of its hash output, and on the size and quality of the key.
