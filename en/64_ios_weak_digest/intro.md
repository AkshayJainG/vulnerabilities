The MD5 algorithm is commonly used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value.
MD5 was designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, but can be used as
a checksum to verify data integrity against unintentional corruption. However, MD5
can be reversed by a brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities.
