Domain whitelisting is a security model that controls access to external
domains over which your application has no control. Cordova provides a
configurable security policy to define which external sites may be
accessed. By default, new apps are configured to allow access to any
site. Before moving your application to production, you should formulate
a whitelist and allow access to specific network domains and subdomains.
