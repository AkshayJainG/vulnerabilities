Jailbreaking is the removing of software restrictions imposed by Apple.
Jailbreaking permits root access to the iOS file system and manager,
allowing the download of additional applications and extensions that are
unavailable through the official Apple App Store. Attackers often target
jailbroken iPhones on which malware can be installed more easily.
