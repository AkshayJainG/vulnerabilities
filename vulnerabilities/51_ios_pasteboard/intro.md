Both iOS and Android support copy/paste. Sensitive data may be stored,
recoverable, or could be modified from the clipboard in clear text,
regardless of whether the source of the data was initially encrypted. If
it is in plaintext at the moment the user copies it, it will be in
plaintext when other applications access the clipboard.
