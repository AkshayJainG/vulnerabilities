Starting with Android 5.0, Google introduced the android.media.projection API which allows any third-party App to perform screen capture and screen sharing (fixed in Android 8).

Such an App can capture everything on the deviceâ€™s screen, including sensitive activity from all other Apps such as password keystrokes, credit card data, etc. The capturing ability remains on even if the user terminates/closes the App, but not after a reboot.
