The `ContentProvider` class provides a mechanism for managing and sharing
data with other applications. When sharing a provider's data with other
apps, access control should be carefully implemented to prohibit
unauthorized access to sensitive data.

There are three ways to limit access to the content provider:

- Public
- Private
- Restricted access
