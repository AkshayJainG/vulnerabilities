Information Property List Files are the files that contain configuration
information about the application executable. These files are stored in
unencrypted form on the device & hence, can be read by anyone by
accessing the application sandbox via any third-party tools (up to iOS
v8.2), by gaining root access to the device (after v8.2) or by taking an
iOS backup.
