A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction.
OTPs avoid a number of shortcomings that are associated with traditional (static) password-based authentication;
a number of implementations also incorporate two factor authentication by ensuring that the one-time password
requires access to something a person has (such as a small keyring fob device with the OTP calculator built
into it, or a smartcard or specific cellphone) as well as something a person knows (such as a PIN).
