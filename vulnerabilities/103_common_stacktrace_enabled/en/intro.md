Application responding with stack trace information are useful to attackers and providing debugging information instead of a generic error response page is considered a bad practice. For instance, it might contain information about internal working of the application.

An attacker can gain information such as version of software, filepath structure of the server, usernames, information about the exception caused, source code etc.
