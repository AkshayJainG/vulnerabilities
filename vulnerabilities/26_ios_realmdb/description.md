Realm databases are used by the applications to store data which can be
further used by the application at later stages. However, these
databases do not have any built-in support for encryption and hence, all
the information is stored in plaintext format in these files. If an
application stores user credentials or some sensitive user specific data
in this database then it can be accessed by any third party.
