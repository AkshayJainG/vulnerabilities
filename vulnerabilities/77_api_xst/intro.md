A Cross-Site Tracing (XST) attack involves the use of Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
and the TRACE or TRACK HTTP methods to be successfully leveraged in some
scenarios to steal legitimate users' credentials. This attack technique was
discovered by Jeremiah Grossman in 2003, in an attempt to bypass the HttpOnly
tag that Microsoft introduced in Internet Explorer 6 SP1 to protect cookies from
being accessed by JavaScript.
