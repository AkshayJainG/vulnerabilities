PhoneGap uses web technology to help bridge the gap between mobile and
web.

Applications built for PhoneGap are hybrid apps, and are neither fully
native or truly web-based, living somewhere in between. Because mobile
OSes don't natively support HTML5 and JavaScript, PhoneGap apps use
WebView, a web container that allows mobile devices to execute
JavaScript and HTML5. WebView (called various terms for differing
platforms) helps bridge the gap between web and mobile, and various
plugins help make an application more robust and native-feeling.

Communicating with each OS, PhoneGap uses different APIs (built by
PhoneGap) and plugins (both native and custom), which act as the bridge
between each platform's native language and the PhoneGap script. Out of
the box, PhoneGap comes with APIs for Camera, Contacts, Compass, Media,
FileSystem and more. Plugins extend those functionalities not accessible
with the available APIs.
