Attackers can run tools like Cycript, GDB, Snoop-it etc. to perform
runtime analysis and steal sensitive data from within applications. To
add an extra layer of security for your application, you should not
allow your application to be run on a jailbroken device. Note that there
are millions of jailbroken devices, so preventing your app from running
on a jailbroken device could lead to a limited userbase and/or bad App
Store reviews. An alternative option is to block some features in your
application rather than disabling the functionality entirely.
