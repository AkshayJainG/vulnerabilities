Android applications built with the Cordova framework can be launched
through a special intent URL. A specially-crafted URL could cause the
Cordova-based application to start up with a different start page than
the developer intended, including other HTML content stored on the
Android device. This has been the case in all released versions of
Cordova up to 3.5.0, and has been fixed in the latest release (3.5.1).
We recommend affected projects to update their applications to the
latest release.
