An XML External Entity Injection is a type of attack against an application that
parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an
external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may
lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request
forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is
located, and other system impacts.
