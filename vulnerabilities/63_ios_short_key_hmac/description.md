The key for HMAC can be of any length. However, less than 32 bytes is strongly discouraged
as it would decrease the security strength of the function. Keys longer than 64 bytes are acceptable
but the extra length would not significantly increase the function strength.
A longer key may be advisable if the randomness of the key is considered weak.
